[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HyperText Markup Language), the language of the web,
is no longer the only language of the web. But it still is the primary language in which source
code of webpages is shared. Originally, HTML pages were always static: the only HTML source of a
web page was that was downloaded from a website. Nowadays, much HTML the is visualized in your
web browser, is generated on the fly with JavaScript. In fact, that is exactly what you will
learn to do in this course.

HTML has many dialects, and HTML5 is the upcoming next version. The features have become so
extensive that we will not have capture half of them; instead, we will stick to the bare
minimum needed. But even at an minimum, writing a web page with HTML code is basically writing
source code. The compiled version is the view of the webpage your web browser shows you. One
important difference is that HTML is much more like a data model representation than it is like
computational instructions. That is, rather than saying things like `put("String", xCoord, yCoord)`,
we define what is to be shown in in what order with general instructions. Well, in pure HTML
that is. [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (CSS) is quite outside the
scope of this course.

A minimal HTML page looks like:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  Hello world!
  </body>
</html>
```

When we think about this structure, we notice that it is not unlike the key-value maps we
covered earlier. For example, compare it to this
[JSON](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.nl/2013/10/programming-in-life-sciences-10.html):

```json
{
  "html": {
    "head":{},
    "body":{value:"Hello world!"}
  }
}
```

Even if we introduce HTML attributes:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1><a name="hello">Hello world!</a></h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

The JSON equivalent would be:

```json
{
  "html": {
    "head":{},
    "body":{
      "h1":{
        "a":{
          attributes:{"name":"hello"},
          value:"Hello world!"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So, while these are quite different languages than programming languages, we can clearly
see they have been made up by the same (computer science) people. But in my opinion, this
is an advantage: because we only need to learn the underlying patterns and can then much
more easily switch between different language.

Now, returning to the HTML example, we introduce a bit of terminology. Let's start with
the last example:

```html
<h1><a name="hello">Hello world!</a></h1>
```

This HTML code example shows the `<h1>` **element** which has one **child element**
`<a>`. This child element has an **attribute** `@name`. Elements can contain string content,
such as the `<a>` element has, and one or more child elements (and any combination of that).
Attributes can only have string content. The HTML specification defines in detail which
elements can be child elements of other elements. For example, the `<head>` element can
only be a child element of `<html>`. Similarly, each HTML element can only have specific
attributes, though some attributes can be attached to any element.

There is plenty of documentation on the web, but there are also tools that can help us write
HTML. For example, the [http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/). This website
detects errors in your HTML code, and is quite helpful if you are new to editing HTML, as
well as useful if you have a lot of HTML experience.

HTML elements you may find useful include the following:

*  `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h5>`: these are header and can be used to make sections
* `<p>`: indicates a paragraph
* `<div id="someID">`: indicates a section of text. The content of any element with an id attribute can be replaced by any appropriate HTML content with JavaScript
* `<a href="http://...">some link</a>`: this is used to make hyperlinks, href means hyperlink reference
* `<a name="mark1">some text</a>`: this is used to create bookmarks. with `<a href="#mark1">jump to section Mark 1</a>`
* `<script>`: used to include JavaScript code in your HTML page
* `<head>`: this HTML blob contains metadata, a list of libraries to be loaded, but also JavaScript which is executed before the HTML `<body>` is processed
* `<body>`: this contains the HTML that is depicted in your browser window

Keep the HTML simple; the programming is more important.

**Exercise**: below is part of the HTML/JavaScript [source code](https://github.com/egonw/mscpils/blob/master/example1.html)
behind [this app](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.nl/2013/10/programming-in-life-sciences-5.html).
Please indicate which lines are HTML source code, and what is JavaScript.
