As said, [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is the format we will use as serialization format
for answers given by the [Open PHACTS LDA](https://dev.openphacts.org/docs). The API actually supports
XML, RDF, HTML, and TSV too, but I think JSON is a good balance between expressiveness and compactness.
Moreover, and perhaps a much better argument, JSON works very well in a JavaScript environment: it is
very easy to convert the serialization into a data model:

```javascript
var jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);
```

Now, we previously covered maps. Maps have keys and values: the keys unlock a particular value.
For example, take this JavaScript:

```javascript
var map = { "key": "value", "key2": "value2" };
```

We define here a key-value object, and we can access the two values with the two keys:

```javascript
map["key2"]; // == value2
```

These examples are JavaScript source code. Not a string. The content of the map variable is a data
structure. But when we communicate with a web service, we need a (string) serialization of the data
model, because we cannot send around memory pointers (which a variable is) because they are only
valid on a single machine.

This is where the JSON format comes in. We can convert the content of the above map variable into a
string representation with this code:

```javascript
var mapStringified = JSON.stringify(map);
```

which gives us the following output:

```json
{"key":"value","key2":"value2"}
```

This string looks an awful lot like the JavaScript code we wrote earlier.

And, likewise we can convert the JSON string back into a JavaScript data model again, with:

```javascript
var mapAgain = JSON.parse(mapStringified);
```

Now, I did warn you earlier that values can be lists and maps itself again, so consider this
JSON example from Wikipedia:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Foo",
    "price": 123,
    "tags": [ "Bar", "Eek" ],
    "stock": {
        "warehouse": 300,
        "retail": 20
    }
}
```

Here we see that the value behind the stock key is another map, and the value behind the tags
key is a list. This creates a quite flexible serialization format, which is happily used by
Open PHACTS. (And for the semantic web readers, yes, we can make JSON more semantic. The Open
PHACTS LDA supports a "rdfjson" format.)
