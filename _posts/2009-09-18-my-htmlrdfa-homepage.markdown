Finally got around to adding a few more bits to my new science homepage: [egonw.github.com](http://egonw.github.com/). Cool thing about this new page is that it is
[HTML+RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/), so, my new [FOAF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_%28software%29) profile is embedded in the HTML:

Down the bottom is link to extract the RDF triples:

Next, is to write a piece of code that creates HTML+RDFa+BIBO from a BibTeX file, and to write a plugin for Bioclipse to extract triples from HTML+RDFA.
