[Ola](http://www.blogger.com/profile/10379047094508592338) is releasing [Bioclipse](http://bioclipse.net/) [2.2.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioclipse/files/bioclipse2/bioclipse2.2.0/)
today, and asked me to show case the semantic web functionality in Bioclipse. I realized that I do not have a nice page showing the semantic web overview. But I did blog a lot about RDF functionality, so here's a list of pointers:

* [Bioclipse Manager for MyExperiment.org](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/11/bioclipse-manager-for-myexperimentorg.html)
* [Bioclipse, RDF and defeasible reasoning](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/09/bioclipse-rdf-and-defeasible-reasoning.html) (see also [Samuel's blog](http://saml.rilspace.com/))
* [Bioclipse and SPARQL end points #2: MyExperiment](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/08/bioclipse-and-sparql-end-points-2.html)
* [Bioclipse and SPARQL end points](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/08/bioclipse-and-sparql-end-points.html)
* [Solubility Data in Bioclipse #2: handling RDF](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/02/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-2-handling.html)
* [Solubility Data in Bioclipse #3: Finding ChEBI IDs](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/02/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-3-finding.html)
* [Solubility Data in Bioclipse #4: Finding ChEBI IDs (Again, but better)](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/03/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-4-finding.html)

One thing I have not blogged about yet (I think), is that the Bioclipse RDF manager also understands RDFa now. Well, sort of... it relies on a webservice, but this is what the script looks like:

```javascript
model = rdf.createStore()
rdf.importRDFa(model, "http://egonw.github.com/")
rdf.saveRDFN3(model, "/Virtual/egonw.n3")
```

With support of SPARQL end points, and reading RDF from web resources directly (RDF/XML, N3, RDFa), Bioclipse is ready for the chemical semantic web.
